                            My story began in <b>Mahayag, Zamboanga del Sur</b>, a place where time seemed to move a little slower. With my parents away working to provide for us, I was raised by my <i>Lolo</i> and <i>Lola</i> in their humble home on the farm. It was a life of simplicity—surrounded by open fields, the smell of earth, and the sounds of nature—but it was also a life of isolation. Our neighbors were distant, and often, my only companions were the cats and dogs roaming our yard.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because I lacked playmates, I learned to find joy in the mundane. I would spend hours sitting on the porch, mesmerized by the chickens pecking at their feed. Feeding the pigs became a daily ritual I surprisingly looked forward to. My fondest memories, however, were the quiet afternoons spent fishing with my grandfather. Whether we caught something or came home empty-handed didn't matter; it was the silence we shared that I cherished.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The house only truly felt alive when my cousins visited. I remember one specific heartbreak vividly: the day they had to leave, I stole my cousin's slippers and threw them away, thinking that if they couldn't walk, they couldn't leave. I cried for hours that day, terrified of the silence returning. But there was magic there, too. I remember a specific season when the house would fill with butterflies of every color. Watching them alongside my grandfather as we walked home to the smell of my grandmother’s cooking is a memory I still hold close. It was a lonely childhood in some ways, but it was undeniably beautiful.

                            Transitioning into high school was a shock to the system. I went from the quiet isolation of the farm to a world of noise, chaos, and social awkwardness. I was a shy kid trying to find my footing. In Grade 8, in a desperate attempt to get exempted from some subject requirements, I made the terrifying decision to join the school pageant. I remember standing on that stage, knees shaking uncontrollably, blinded by the lights, instantly regretting my choice. Yet, looking back, that moment of vulnerability was my first step out of my shell.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I eventually found my tribe—a group of friends who were loud, chaotic, and always ready for adventure. Our sanctuary wasn't a library, but the local <b>Lemon Square</b>, where we’d hoard snacks and scream over intense matches of mobile games. I also developed a funny sort of dedication to my studies, specifically driven by a crush on my Math and Science teacher. I would study late into the night, not just for grades, but for the brief moment of validation when I could raise my hand and impress her with the correct answer. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But just as we were hitting our stride, the world stopped. The <i>COVID-19</i> pandemic hit, and our high school life was cut short without a proper goodbye. The prom, the graduation rites, the final days of just being kids—all canceled. We were locked down, separated by screens. It was an incomplete ending to a significant chapter, but it taught me to value the memories we did manage to make before the world went quiet.

                            College was supposed to be the start of my dream to become a nurse. I had a vision of myself in white, taking care of people, healing them. I applied to <b>PLM</b> and <b>UE</b>, holding onto that hope. But life had a different plot twist waiting for me. PLM ran out of slots, and with my options limited, I found myself enrolling at <b>UE</b> for a course I barely understood: <b>Computer Science</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I walked into this field thinking it would be about computers; I didn't realize it would be about logic, patience, and failure. The learning curve was brutal. I remember the rush of my first "Hello World," followed immediately by nights where I stared at a monitor for six hours hunting for a single missing semicolon. I have skipped meals and lost sleep over logic errors that turned out to be simple typos. It is a love-hate relationship; the frustration is overwhelming, but the dopamine rush when a code finally runs successfully is addictive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Along the way, I discovered that Computer Science isn't just about math and logic—it's a canvas. My interest in <b>Game Development</b> and <b>Web Design</b> allowed me to bridge my technical skills with my creative side. I began channeling my love for stories (like Philippine mythology) into game concepts. I found friends who struggle alongside me, sharing the same panic over deadlines and the same joy over solutions. I may not be a nurse, but I am learning to build things that help people in a different way. I am still figuring it out, one syntax error at a time.
